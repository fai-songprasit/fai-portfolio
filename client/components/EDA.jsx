                <p>
                    My career started when I enrolled 
                    at <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">
                    EDA</a> in 2020 for the Kotare cohort, 
                    which began in May 2020 and finished at the start of 
                    August 2020. It is safe to say that before this course, 
                    I have had next to no experience with programming.
