                    Blogging was a big part of foundation. It serves as 
                    a way for the students to pratice building a website 
                    using the tools that are currently at our disposal 
                    and adapting to new tech as they are learnt.

                    Another crucial role of this tool was for learning 
                    reflections. The blog itself was another way for us 
                    to reflect on our learning in writing and forces us 
                    to document our progress as we go. Figuring out 
                    what my strengths and weaknesses were and finding 
                    the best way that best optimises my learning outcome.
