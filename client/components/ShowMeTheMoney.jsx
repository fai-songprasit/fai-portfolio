                    This was the first project with a pre-set scenario, MVP and 
                    ReadMe document. Our client was Google and we were tasked 
                    with creating a meeting cost tracker using part of someone 
                    else's code base. The base came pre-programmed with 
                    authenthication and SaaS.

                    For this project we worked in a much larger team of 7 people. 
                    I was in charge of the overall CSS for this project and the 
                    logic behind the dashboard and history display.
