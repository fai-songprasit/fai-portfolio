                    If you're here then you're probably curious about what I 
                    can do as a developer. You will find that the contents 
                    of this page has been ordered chronologically across the 
                    Web-Dev saga of my life, which began only recently, and 
                    will continue to grow as I expand into this industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having been in the hospitality industry for most of my working 
                    career, it was safe to say that I have had next to no experience 
                    with programming prior to EDA. In hindsight, I wish I had made 
                    the switch sooner as I didn't realise how much I was going to 
                    enjoy the challenge and how rewarding and gratifying it would be 
                    have all the tests pass and have created something myself 
                    completely from scratch.
                </p>

                    So without further ado, allow me to introduce 
                    myself.

                    web developer.
