                    If you're here then you're probably curious about what I 
                    can do as a developer. You will find that the contents 
                    of this page has been ordered chronologically across the 
                    Web-Dev saga of my life, which began only recently, and 
                    will continue to grow as I expand into this industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having been in the hospitality industry for most of my working 
                    career, it was safe to say that I have had next to no experience 
                    with programming prior to EDA. Thinking about this after
                    the fact, I wish I had made the switch sooner as I didn't realise 
                    how much I was going to enjoy the challenge and how rewarding
                    and gratifying it would be to have all the tests pass and have 
                    created something myself completely from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So without further ado, please allow me to introduce 
                    myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Fai Songprasit and I am a Junior full-stack 
                    web developer.
