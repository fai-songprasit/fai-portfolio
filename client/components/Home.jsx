                    If you're here then you're probably curious about what I 
                    can do as a developer. You will find that the contents 
                    of this page has been ordered chronologically across the 
                    Web-Dev saga of my life, which began only recently, and 
                    will continue to grow as I expand into this industry.

                    So without further ado, please allow me to introduce 
                    myself.

                    My name is Fai Songprasit and I am a Junior full-stack 
                    web developer.
