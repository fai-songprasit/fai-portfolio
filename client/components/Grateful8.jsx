                    Grateful-8 is a web app that uses and external API to
                    rendomly generate a response to any questions typed inside
                    the input field.

                    In this project I was in charge of the front-end designs 
                    of the page, which also incuded the use of SVG. SVG was 
                    particularly challenging for me as it obeyed a different 
                    set of rules from the CSS that I was used to.

                    in conjunction with React router.
