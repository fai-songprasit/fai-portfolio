                    Life of The party is a web app built using React state and 
                    consumes an external API. This app uses a REST API that contains 
                    the contents of a standard deck of cards without jokers. 
                    This app simulates a drinking game called Red or Black, where 
                    players guess from three different categories. The questions 
                    and buttons change dynamically.

                    for the project.
